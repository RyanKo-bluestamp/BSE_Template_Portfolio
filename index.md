# Shoulder Recovery Device with TinyML
Hi everyone! My name is Ryan, and my main project is the Shoulder Recovery Device with TinyML. 

Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# Starter Project

For my starter project, I made the Arduino starter. Through jumper wires, I connected the Arduino Uno to a breadboard. The photoresistor on the breadboard detects the intensity of light above it (input) and either lights up or dims the LED (output) as a result of its analog reading. For example, when I place my finger over the photoresistor, and it detects a light intensity less than 800, the LED lights up. When I remove my finger and the photoresistor detects a light intensity greater than 800, the LED dims. One major challenge I faced when making the Arduino starter was the photoresistor's incompability with another resistor on the breadboard, which was much weaker. After realizing this issue, however, it didn't take long for me to find a compatible resistor, and it was able to power my project. Since my main project, the Shoulder Recovery Device with TinyML also uses the Arduino Uno, this starter project was extremely beneficial towards my understanding of how to work with one. Attached below is the LED schematic I used as a reference:

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
